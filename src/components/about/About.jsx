          My name is Dylan McCapes and I'm a full stack web developer located in
          the San Francisco Bay Area. I attended UC Berkeley where I earned a
          degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. After college I
          honed my full stack web development skills by completing a three month
          intensive coding bootcamp App Academy. Check out some of my projects
